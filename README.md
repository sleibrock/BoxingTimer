Boxing Timer Arduino
====================

A simple clock/timer board and program for those who need a timer but
would much prefer it if it were on an Arduino board.

Workout is a simple 3-minute round / 1 minute break routine. Can be
adjusted to have longer rounds / shorter breaks etc by editing the
source file's `#define` constants at the top.
